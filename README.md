# Mini Follow & Fool Arcade; AKA Mini Simon Says Arcade (CS362 Project)

The display project code requires "Adafruit_GFX.h" and "MCUFRIEND_kbv" library files to be downloaded, through the Arduino IDE's "Manage Libraries..." section found in "Tools".

This code is for a small arcade-like machine where two players can play a simple game, similar to the Simon Says childrenâ€™s game where players must follow the commands of the CPU-controlled leader character, using buttons and a joystick. The game is played through one controller Arduino, and visually displayed through a display Arduino connected to an LCD screen, with a buzzer attached to the display as well.

Documentation file (w/ steps and materials for building) included in repo, titled "Mini Follow And Fool Arcade (Group 34, CS 362)".
